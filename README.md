# Mizumi Kuma - A Small infinite runner turned Platformer made in HaxeFlixel.

---

*This requires [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6 or higher) to be installed to run most of the commands below.*


### 1. Install dependencies

```sh
npm i 
```

### 2. Build
It's recommended to run the [Haxe compilation server](https://youtu.be/3crCJlVXy-8) when developing to cache the compilation, this should be done in a separate terminal window/tab with the following command.
```sh
npm run comp-server
```

Your **.hx** files are watched with [Facebook's watman plugin](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/). Anytime you save a file it will trigger an automatic rebuild. 
```sh
npm start 
```

You can then play the game through localhost. 
Or you can play it on here.
